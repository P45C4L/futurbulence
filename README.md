The Futurbulence Manifesto

This is an ongoing project aiming at reframing the role of design and designers within organizations. As we're shifting form old and traditional models of design to a new paradigm of collaboration and self-organization, this manifesto tries to define the core principles behind the new required mindset ofr 21st century design.

Started May 23rd 2013, this document is mainly based on my experience working in the field and is mainly based on first hand observations rather than theoretical ideos and concepts. There is a fundamentally practical reality behind this work.
