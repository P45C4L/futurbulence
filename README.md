The Futurbulence Design Manifesto

This is an ongoing project aiming at reframing the role of design and designers within organizations in order to address a more unstable future. As we're shifting form old and traditional models of design to a new paradigm of purpose and meaning, this manifesto tries to define the core principles behind the new required mindset of 21st century design.

To understand the scope of this manifesto, it is necessary to put into a larger planetary context. What design philosophy is required to design today's world for tomorrow challenges?

Started on the 20th of May 2013, this document is mainly based on my experience working in the field and is entirely based on first hand observations rather than theoretical ideas and concepts. There is a fundamentally practical reality behind this work.
